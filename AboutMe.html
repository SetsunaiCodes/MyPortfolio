                    <p class="TWBottomtext">The answer is actually quiet simple. I was suprised by the way people present content their own way on webpages. There a plenty of layouts you could accosiate to their website within seconds. This is what I want to achieve at some point of my life aswell. Creating a Website everybody could define the layout to. For example: All of you know how the YouTube index is looking right? Or the Netffix overlay? Amazon? You get the hang. Everything I know was taught by "The Odin Project" and I'm still coding through their programm while making money with coding webpages and designing Social Media content. So big shoutout and thanks to the developers of "The Odin Project"!</p>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext"><span class="tuerkis"> If you want to learn Fullstack Webdevelopement I recommend "The Odin Project", Not sponsered!</span></p>

                    <h1 class="TWheading tuerkis">What do I do when I don't code?</h1>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext">I'm a bit of a chlichee to be honest. There is this saying that every programmer is somehow connected with gaming... I love playing videogames, sinking into new worlds, explore their secrets and read everything about their lore and fall for their characters. These deeply touching storybased games like "The Last of Us" or "Life is Strange" get me in a way no other game can. I also like playing "Overwatch" (I don't know why I'm good at this game, I do not play any other shooter games) and another gaming passion I have is "Monster Hunter". Grinding these Monsters is some kind of therapy for me and I can spend 100 of hours grinding.</p>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext">I also play Tennis and played Badminton in the past. You can't image how important it is to stay active, esspecially when your job is sitting infront of a monitor for hours and ontop of that play videogames. Your back tends to hurt at some point and your knees don't move. And yes it's a bit revealing to power-shot these Tennis balls.</p>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext">Here is a also not sponsered pro tip if you love videogames and doing sports. Try out RingFit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch. The results are amazing.</p>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext"><span class="tuerkis">Which is why I founded Revived Gaming. A blog that covers the latest news about upcoming games and series!</span></p>

                    <p class="TWBottomtext">I have to admit that I'm not just a bit proud of that project. Revived is fully founded and administrated by me. You can see this as a "Multimedia-type-of-blog" where you can find the latest information about upcoming Games, Series and Movies that could fullfill a nerds heart like I am one. This Blog is fully written in German but an English Version is in the making. I also post reviews, previews, honest opinions, Rankings and Analysis. So for the Germans of you: Ich kann euch Revived echt ans Herz legen, da steckt sehr viel Arbeit und Liebe hinter!</p>
