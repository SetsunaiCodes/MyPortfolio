                <p class="TWBottomtext">My mother-in-law is the leader of a district administration center located in Hamburg/Germany. Due to my girlfriends birthday we went to the restaurant together where she told me that she had plans for a Newsletter but has no clue how to make this possible. This is where I entered the field, so I said that I "might have an idea". The result is the Newsletterpage you can see here!</p>

                <h1 class="tuerkis TWheading">How does it work?</h1>
                <p class="TWBottomtext">The front-end is written with HTML and CSS. The white box is a simple div container that contains an image, a heading, a description and the actual form itself. The interesting part is the back-end. This form is supported by Formsubmit which is a service that connects a GMAIL Account of your choice with your form. I choose this option because I knew that my mother-in-law doesn't want to access Software like "MyPHP" all the time and she is good with handling lots of Mails so this option came in perfectly. Whenever someone submits his/her Mail Adress, the submission lands directly in her Mail Inbox. Another benefit is that she can directly add the Mail Adress to the mail distribution list to share the Newsletter.</p>
