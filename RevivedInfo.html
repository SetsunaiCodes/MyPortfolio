                    <p class="TWBottomtext">I am super proud to announce this! Revived is a blog fully founded by myself! Every two days I publish new content about the latest games, trailers, series and movies for geeks like I am one. My intention behind Revived was quiet simple... I like talking about any topic that I am passionate for. There is no better to do so than creating a blog and add a comment section.</p>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext tuerkis"><span class="tuerkis">Important to mention is that Revived is wirtten in German. German is my mothertongue. Revived should be as authentic as possible. There is an english Version in progress tho!</span></p>

                    <p class="TWheading tuerkis">Yes, it's built with WIX</p>
                    <p class="TWBottomtext">As a programmer I might have to explain this further! WIX has the best features for bloggers, in my humble opinion...The Website Creation was kinda hard... If I would have written this page with code it would have been much faster. But now that Version 1 is finished I couldn't be happier. Adding new entries is easy and I can add a personal domain for an effordable pricing, which is going to be done within the next few days!</p>
