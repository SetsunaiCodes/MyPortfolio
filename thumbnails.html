                    <p class="TWBottomtext">Some content creators (no judgement) tend to use the same Thumbnail over and over for the same Project, or they just change the number of the episode, which makes a clean layout but can seem a bit too boring. In my example you can see lots of "Part 001" Thumbnails. Here you can use the main image of the game, but when it comes to further parts I recommend using a screenshot made from the episode the Thumbnail is related to as you can see in the "Life is Strange 2" example. Setting a textured border givees more depth to your YouTube page and makes your Thumbnail stand out from YouTubes layout, which is monocolor. You can even step further and take a part of your background (or take a new png) and set it above your border. By using this technique you can highlight important characters or items (as in the Warframe example). When you decide which color scheme you want to use for your project you should wether take a look at your "Part 001" background (as in the "Spider-Man" example) or take a look at the color of the games logo (as in the "The Evil Within 2" example). Only use complimentary colors if an element of your thumbnail does aswell (as in the "The legend of Zelda" example).</p>

                    <p class="TWBottomtext">Cooking videos always focus straight on 1 result at the end of the visddeo. Unlike Let's Plays you do not have to take care on revealing too much of the video. You SHOULD reveal the outcome, because in this case  you have to think like a consumer. If I'm looking for a pasta recipie then I'm choosing the best looking meal. From a designers perspective there is not much going on, when creating Thumbnails for a cooking channel. Reveal the outcome and try to keep the eye away from the background. Center your meal. If you want to add text, then you can hide it under your meal to create some more depth. The second image includes one important aspect that can't be shown with stock images. Including you! You can take a picture of yourself holding your meal. The uniquest thing you can do is presenting yourself!</p>

                    <p class="TWBottomtext">Music Videos do not grow because of a good looking Thumbnail. They grow because the artists music is streamed no matter how the Thumbnail is looking. But there are still some small things to talk about, when it comes to creating Thumbnails for a Music Video, no matter if we are talking about a band, or a solo artist. You can choose a close-up shot of the artist as shown on the left image or you can be creative and experimental as seen on the right. The Thumbnail for a Music Video can offer some evidence on the vibe of the song.</p>
